## How to not waste your time in coding artificial neural networks

This repository contains the resources for some practical lessons about the Deep Learning part of the Statistical Machine Learning course, held by Prof. Luca Bortolussi for the MSc students in Data Science and Scientific Computing at the University of Trieste.

Within these lessons, I will go through the following topics:

- Lesson 1:
- - Why do we need a deep learning library
  - PyTorch: an overview
  - Static graphs, dynamic graph, automatic differentiation
  - Tensors
  - Autograd

- Lesson 2:
- - Linear model for spiral data
  - NN for spiral data
  - Importing CIFAR10
  - Set up for using GPU
  - Classification of CIFAR10 with a FCNN
  - torch.nn, nn.Module, nn.functionals, optim

- Lesson 3:
- - Convolutional layers
  - Pooling layers
  - Simple CNN (scrambled vs not scrambled)
  - Writing new blocks
  - Saving and loading a model

- Lesson 4:
- - Importing a pretrained model
  - Transfer learning and fine tuning
  - Recurrent neural networks
  - LSTM
  - NLP model

- Lesson 5:
- - Handling data: Dataset and DataLoader
  - Performing data augmentation
  - Generative models
  - Some useful libraries
