# How to not waste your time in coding artificial neural networks

This repository contains the resources for some practical lessons about the Deep Learning part of the Statistical Machine Learning course, held by Prof. Luca Bortolussi for the MSc students in Data Science and Scientific Computing at the University of Trieste.

Within these lessons, I will go through the following topics:

- Lesson 1:
- - Why do we need a deep learning library
  - PyTorch: an overview
  - Static graphs, dynamic graph, automatic differentiation
  - Tensors
  - Autograd
  - Linear model for spiral data
  - NN for spiral data
  - CPU vs GPU 

- Lesson 2:
- - Importing CIFAR10
  - Classification of CIFAR10 with a FCNN
  - torch.nn, nn.Module, nn.functionals, optim
  - Convolutional layers
  - Pooling layers
  - Simple CNN (scrambled vs not scrambled)
  - Writing a resnet-like
  - Importing a pretrained model
  - Transfer learning and fine tuning

- Lesson 3:
- - Handling data: Dataset and DataLoader
  - Recurrent neural networks
  - LSTM
  - NLP model

- Lesson 4:
- - Generative models

- Lesson 5:
- - Some useful libraries
